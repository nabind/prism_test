    <!-- Add additional classes to the deployment module. In this case, it is the same as including the jar in the EAR's lib directory
        [dlitvak] Jboss7 seems to read jars from vfs (virtual) directory: a security mechanism?
        Jboss's classloader assigns vfs location to CodeSource object of the loaded jar classes.
        In order to assign the class object physical deployment module location, wwe found it necessary to introduce this file with
        additional resource roots marked with use-physical-code-source="true" (issue 26780)
