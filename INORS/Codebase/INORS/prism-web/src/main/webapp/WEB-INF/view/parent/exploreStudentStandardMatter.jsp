		<h3>Standards, Testing, and NCLB</h3>

      <p> Parents and care takers, teachers, and schools all have a responsibility to help children acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to earn 
          good jobs,make informed decisions, and become successful and contributing citizens. These skills and knowledge are described by your state's 
          standards.
      </p>
      <p>
		  State testing is one important tool that is used to determine whether your child is achieving these important standards. 
	      In addition, state tests inform decisions regarding the effectiveness of schools' and districts' efforts to support your child. 
	      The federal legislation that sets the parameters for this decision-making process is known as the No Child Left Behind Act (or NCLB). 
	      NCLB is the 2002 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

							<span>What Are Standards and Why Do They Matter?</span>
								<ul class="big-menu report-menu white-gradient">
									<p>
    Standards have long been a part of successful classrooms. Good teachers have always set goals for their students and have worked to help them reach 
    those objectives. State standards clearly articulate these goals to ensure that they are available to everyone. Knowing and understanding the standards
    is one way you can support your childâs education. By knowing what is expected, you can work with your child and his or her teacher(s) to reach these 
    important standards.

    When you first look at a list of standards, you might wonder how teachers and students can be expected to accomplish so much. Even though standards 
    may appear to be a complicated to-do list, they are really just a way of setting learning goals that give your child the greatest opportunity to 
    succeed in whatever he or she decides to do.

    If you've ever played a sport or learned a new skill, you're probably familiar with the importance of goals. In order to improve, you need to know 
    what you can already do and what skills you need to move ahead. In the same way, standards help everyone involved in your child's education stay 
    focused on important skills.

    Each state has its own set of standards for student learning. State standards are based on educational research, the perspective of businesses that 
    may employ your child, post-secondary schools or institutes that require certain entry skills, and a variety of other constituencies. 
    State standards are actually written by teachers, parents, educational leaders, and business people to ensure that students are prepared for future 
    opportunities in Indiana and, quite possibly, nationally or internationally.

							<span>How Is Testing Useful?</span>
								<ul class="big-menu report-menu white-gradient">
									<p>
    Testing is one way to determine if children are reaching standards. We all want our children to be successful, and it's a common worry that your child's
    test results will label him or her as a âgoodâ or âbadâ student. But tests help to identify your child's strengths and highlight skill areas that could 
    be improved, which is essential information for you and your child's teacher(s). In order to make the right decisions about how to help your child, 
    you, and your child's teachers need reliable information about what can be done to help your child achieve the standards. Additionally, testing can 
    help teachers recognize when your child is ready to strive for more challenging goals.

    Test results, along with other information, guide teachers in lesson planning and help them identify appropriate teaching strategies that match each 
    child's needs. As a parent, you may want to talk to your child's teacher(s) about how tests are being used to support instruction.

							<span>What Is No Child Left Behind (NCLB)?</span>
								<ul class="big-menu report-menu white-gradient">
									<p>
    On January 8, 2002, helping all children succeed in school became more than just a goalâit became law. NCLB is a law built upon the tenet that setting 
    high standards for children will help them succeed in school and, ultimately, in life. NCLB holds schools responsible for helping all children learn.

    As your child advances through school, you will probably ask the same question that many parents do: âHow is my child doing?â Your child's teacher will 
    help you answer this question. NCLB requires states to test all students, and then use the results of that test to help parents, and the public in 
    general, understand the extent to which students are meeting standards. Your child's results on this state test will be shared with you. 
    If your child does not score well on a part of the test, it may indicate that he or she needs extra help in that area.

    The results of state tests give both state and federal government a common tool to determine which schools and districts in your state are helping 
    children reach the standards and which schools and districts need to make improvements. As part of NCLB, you will receive a âreport cardâ for your 
    child's school and school district. This report card makes it possible for you to consider how well your school and district helps all students learn, 
    regardless of their background and strengths.
