	<h3>Standards, Testing, and NCLB</h3>

	<p>
		Parents and caretakers, teachers, and schools all have a
		responsibility to help children acquire the skills and knowledge
		necessary to earn good jobs, make informed decisions, and become
		successful and contributing citizens. These skills and knowledge are
		described by your state's <b>standards</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		State <b>testing</b> is one important tool that is used to determine
		whether your child is achieving these important standards. In
		addition, state tests inform decisions regarding the effectiveness of
		schools' and districts' efforts to support your child. The federal
		legislation that sets the parameters for this decision-making process
		is known as the No Child Left Behind Act (or NCLB). <b>NCLB</b> is the
		2002 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

				&nbsp; What Are Standards and Why Do They Matter?
			</dt>
			<dd style="height: auto; display: none;"
				class="accordion-body with-padding">
				<p>Standards have long been a part of successful classrooms.
					Good teachers have always set goals for their students and have
					worked to help them reach those objectives. State standards clearly
					articulate these goals to ensure that they are available to
					everyone. Knowing and understanding the standards is one way you
					can support your child's education. By knowing what is expected,
					you can work with your child and his or her teacher(s) to reach
					these important standards.</p>
				<p>When you first look at a list of standards, you might wonder
					how teachers and students can be expected to accomplish so much.
					Even though standards may appear to be a complicated to-do list,
					they are really just a way of setting learning goals that give your
					child the greatest opportunity to succeed in whatever he or she
					decides to do.</p>
				<p>If you've ever played a sport or learned a new skill, you're
					probably familiar with the importance of goals. In order to
					improve, you need to know what you can already do and what skills
					you need to move ahead. In the same way, standards help everyone
					involved in your child's education stay focused on important
					skills.</p>
				<p>Each state has its own set of standards for student learning.
					State standards are based on educational research, the perspective
					of businesses that may employ your child, post-secondary schools or
					institutes that require certain entry skills, and a variety of
					other constituencies. State standards are actually written by
					teachers, parents, educational leaders, and business people to
					ensure that students are prepared for future opportunities in
					Indiana and, quite possibly, nationally or internationally.</p>

				&nbsp; How Is Testing Useful?
			</dt>
			<dd style="height: auto;" class="accordion-body with-padding">
				<p>Testing is one way to determine if children are reaching
					standards. We all want our children to be successful, and it's a
					common worry that your child's test results will label him or her
					as a "good" or "bad" student. But tests help to identify your
					child's strengths and highlight skill areas that could be improved,
					which is essential information for you and your child's teacher(s).
					In order to make the right decisions about how to help your child,

					you, and your child's teachers need reliable information about what
					can be done to help your child achieve the standards. Additionally,
					testing can help teachers recognize when your child is ready to
					strive for more challenging goals.</p>
				<p>Test results, along with other information, guide teachers in
					lesson planning and help them identify appropriate teaching
					strategies that match each child's needs. As a parent, you may want
					to talk to your child's teacher(s) about how tests are being used
					to support instruction.</p>

				&nbsp; What Is No Child Left Behind (NCLB)?
			</dt>
			<dd style="height: auto;" class="accordion-body with-padding">
				<p>On January 8, 2002, helping all children succeed in school
					became more than just a goal-it became law. NCLB is a law built
					upon the tenet that setting high standards for children will help
					them succeed in school and, ultimately, in life. NCLB holds schools
					responsible for helping all children learn.</p>
				<p>As your child advances through school, you will probably ask
					the same question that many parents do: "How is my child doing?"
					Your child's teacher will help you answer this question. NCLB
					requires states to test all students, and then use the results of
					that test to help parents, and the public in general, understand
					the extent to which students are meeting standards. Your child's
					results on this state test will be shared with you. If your child
					does not score well on a part of the test, it may indicate that he
					or she needs extra help in that area.</p>
				<p>The results of state tests give both state and federal
					government a common tool to determine which schools and districts
					in your state are helping children reach the standards and which
					schools and districts need to make improvements. As part of NCLB,
					you will receive a "report card" for your child's school and school
					district. This report card makes it possible for you to consider
					how well your school and district helps all students learn,
					regardless of their background and strengths.</p>
