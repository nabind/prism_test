					Your Child's Interests</span>
				<p>
				<ul class="white-gradient">
					Researchers found that children who spend their free time pursing
					hobbies or activities they enjoy usually perform better on reading
					tasks. This is because they end up spending a great deal of time on
					organized learning tasks. Yet many children haven't developed
					hobbies or haven't yet discovered their passions. Take some time to
					explore your child‚Äôs interests. Then help him take part in an
					activity he likes to do in his free time. Here are some ways to
					explore your child's interests: Play games together. Find out what
					kinds of games your child likes. Does your child like games that
					involve strategy? Does she enjoy games with letters and words? How
					does your child feel about trivia or facts? How about games with
					numbers? Playing different types of games will help your child
					learn about his or her interests. You could even have your child
					create her own games. Pay attention to what your child reads. What
					types of books get your child's attention? If your child doesn‚Äôt
					know where to start, ask the librarian to help your child find an
					interesting book. Discovering books that engage your child can help
					lead to related activities of interest. For example, if your child
					enjoys reading about the wilderness, then maybe she would want to
					join a scouting club or learn how to fish. Talk to your child about
					what he is learning in school. Does your child like one subject
					more than another? Why? What kinds of classroom activities does
					your child enjoy? How does your child feel about non-academic
					subjects, such as art and music? If he could do one thing all day
					at school, what would it be and why?

			<li class="with-right-arrow" id="select-tooltip-2"><span>Integrate
					Learning into Everyday Activities</span>
				<ul class="white-gradient">
					<p>Children who have opportunities to learn at home do better
						in school. One way parents can help their children learn at home
						is to combine learning with things they already do every day.
						Research shows you can improve your child‚Äôs academic performance
						with little effort. Here are some ways to combine learning with
						Everyday Activities: Having your child help with household chores,
						such as caring for a pet, is a great way to give her practice
						reading. Instead of telling your child what you want her to do,
						write a note describing how you would do the feeding, cleaning,
						etc. Give clear directions to follow. Make sure the directions
						have more than one step. The older your child is, the more steps
						she can follow. You can also have your child write you a note
						about what she was able to do. Ask your child to summarize (tell
						you the main idea) of something he read, watched, or did. For
						example, have your child tell you what happened on a favorite
						television show, or ask your child to read a newspaper article and
						then tell you about it. Have your child read labels or ingredients
						on food packages. Pose questions that are useful and interest you.
						For example, it‚Äôs important to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of
						water per day. Some bottled water containers write the contents
						they hold in liters. Have your child convert liters into ounces to
						figure out how many bottles of water you would have to drink to
						get sixty-four ounces.</p>
				</ul></li>

			<li class="with-right-arrow" id="select-tooltip-3"><span>Read
					with Your Child</span>
				<ul class="white-gradient">
					<p>Reading with your child for just twenty minutes a day can
						significantly improve his or her performance in school. Most
						children love hearing books read aloud, so read together as often
						as possible. It can only help your child. Here are some ways to
						read with your child: Go to the library, a book sale, or a
						bookstore with a fun goal in mind. Maybe you want to come up with
						a menu for a special family dinner. Perhaps you want to look into
						a road trip you can do with the family. Either way, the idea is to
						leave with books your child has an interest in reading with you.
						Having a fun goal to work toward will give you both the motivation
						you need to get it done. Make sure you get a few books so that you
						have enough to last you a while. Partner read. You read a part out
						loud. Then ask your child to read the next part to you. Take turns
						reading like this until you finish the book. The key is to pick a
						book that interests both of you. Look on the book shelves of your
						home talk to a librarian or a store clerk. There is an endless
						amount of great children‚Äôs literature today. While you are
						reading, take turns asking each other questions. Ask your child to
						guess what will happen next, or talk about something that just
						happened. Would he act the same way as the person in the book? Set
						a regular reading time. Reading is a good way to wind down before
						sleeping. Make sure your child gets ready for bed early enough
						that you have time to read together before bedtime. If you are not
						home when your child goes to bed, try reading together before she
						goes to school. If you work in the evening, read together right
						before you leave for work.</p>

			<li class="with-right-arrow" id="select-tooltip-4"><span>Help
					Your Child Understand How to Be Successful</span>
				<ul class="white-gradient">
					<p>Children do better in school when they know how to be
						successful. Many children think success is something that just
						happens. Yet research shows that most people can do well if they
						put forth effort. Here are some ways to help your child understand
						how to be successful: - Help your child understand that success
						comes from hard work. Children can learn subject-specific skills
						if they take the time and put forth effort. Many children label
						themselves as ‚Äúgood at math‚Äù or ‚Äúbad at reading.‚Äù Explain to your
						child that hard work is the most important ingredient in doing
						well. Praise your child for working hard. - Give your child
						chances to do well at something he finds difficult. Choose a
						subject that your child finds challenging. Then work on one small
						skill in that subject. This makes it a task your child can handle.
						For example, if your child is struggling with reading, help him
						focus on understanding the main idea. Have your child retell the
						story in his own words. Ask your child‚Äôs teacher for ways to help.
						Keep building small successes to turn them into big ones. - Give
						your child challenging work in a subject she thinks is easy. Ask
						your child‚Äôs teacher for ideas if necessary. For example, if your
						child thinks reading is easy, give her a book with a complex
						story. Or find a book with more advanced vocabulary. Then reading
						will be more challenging. Your child will have to work hard to be
						successful. Help your child see that this can be a rewarding
						experience.</p>
