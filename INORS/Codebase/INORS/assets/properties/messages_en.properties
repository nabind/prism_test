p.everyDayActivitiesDetail.1 = Your day-to-day involvement in your child's education makes an important difference to their success in school. According to research published by the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory*, students whose parents are involved in their education, regardless of income or background, are more likely to.
p.everyDayActivitiesDetail.2 = - Earn higher grades and test scores, and enroll in higher-level programs.<br> - Get promoted, pass classes, and earn credits<br> - Attend school regularly<br> - Have better social skills, improved behavior, and adapt well to school<br> - Graduate and go on to post-secondary education<br>
p.everyDayActivitiesDetail.3 = These Everyday Activities give you practical guidance on how to take part in your child'Äôs education. They help create a learning-rich home environment, making education a natural part of your family'Äôs daily routine. These activities, along with your own ideas that the activities may inspire, will help your child develop the lifelong study skills and enthusiasm for learning that ensures continued achievement and success.
p.everyDayActivitiesDetail.4 = Researchers found that children who spend their free time pursing hobbies or activities they enjoy usually perform better on reading tasks. This is because they end up spending a great deal of time on organized learning tasks. Yet many children haven't developed hobbies or haven't yet discovered their passions. Take some time to explore your child‚Äôs interests. Then help him take part in an activity he likes to do in his free time. Here are some ways to explore your child's interests: Play games together. Find out what kinds of games your child likes. Does your child like games that involve strategy? Does she enjoy games with letters and words? How does your child feel about trivia or facts? How about games with numbers? Playing different types of games will help your child learn about his or her interests. You could even have your child create her own games. Pay attention to what your child reads. What types of books get your child's attention? If your child doesn‚Äôt know where to start, ask the librarian to help your child find an interesting book. Discovering books that engage your child can help lead to related activities of interest. For example, if your child enjoys reading about the wilderness, then maybe she would want to join a scouting club or learn how to fish. Talk to your child about what he is learning in school. Does your child like one subject more than another? Why? What kinds of classroom activities does your child enjoy? How does your child feel about non-academic subjects, such as art and music? If he could do one thing all day at school, what would it be and why?
p.everyDayActivitiesDetail.5 = Children who have opportunities to learn at home do better in school. One way parents can help their children learn at home is to combine learning with things they already do every day. Research shows you can improve your child‚Äôs academic performance with little effort. Here are some ways to combine learning with Everyday Activities: Having your child help with household chores, such as caring for a pet, is a great way to give her practice reading. Instead of telling your child what you want her to do, write a note describing how you would do the feeding, cleaning, etc. Give clear directions to follow. Make sure the directions have more than one step. The older your child is, the more steps she can follow. You can also have your child write you a note about what she was able to do. Ask your child to summarize (tell you the main idea) of something he read, watched, or did. For example, have your child tell you what happened on a favorite television show, or ask your child to read a newspaper article and then tell you about it. Have your child read labels or ingredients on food packages. Pose questions that are useful and interest you. For example, it‚Äôs important to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. Some bottled water containers write the contents they hold in liters. Have your child convert liters into ounces to figure out how many bottles of water you would have to drink to get sixty-four ounces.
p.everyDayActivitiesDetail.6 = Reading with your child for just twenty minutes a day can significantly improve his or her performance in school. Most children love hearing books read aloud, so read together as often as possible. It can only help your child. Here are some ways to read with your child: Go to the library, a book sale, or a bookstore with a fun goal in mind. Maybe you want to come up with a menu for a special family dinner. Perhaps you want to look into a road trip you can do with the family. Either way, the idea is to leave with books your child has an interest in reading with you. Having a fun goal to work toward will give you both the motivation you need to get it done. Make sure you get a few books so that you have enough to last you a while. Partner read. You read a part out loud. Then ask your child to read the next part to you. Take turns reading like this until you finish the book. The key is to pick a book that interests both of you. Look on the book shelves of your home talk to a librarian or a store clerk. There is an endless amount of great children‚Äôs literature today. While you are reading, take turns asking each other questions. Ask your child to guess what will happen next, or talk about something that just happened. Would he act the same way as the person in the book? Set a regular reading time. Reading is a good way to wind down before sleeping. Make sure your child gets ready for bed early enough that you have time to read together before bedtime. If you are not home when your child goes to bed, try reading together before she goes to school. If you work in the evening, read together right before you leave for work.
p.everyDayActivitiesDetail.7 = Children do better in school when they know how to be successful. Many children think success is something that just happens. Yet research shows that most people can do well if they put forth effort. Here are some ways to help your child understand how to be successful: - Help your child understand that success comes from hard work. Children can learn subject-specific skills if they take the time and put forth effort. Many children label themselves as ‚Äúgood at math‚Äù or ‚Äúbad at reading.‚Äù Explain to your child that hard work is the most important ingredient in doing well. Praise your child for working hard. - Give your child chances to do well at something he finds difficult. Choose a subject that your child finds challenging. Then work on one small skill in that subject. This makes it a task your child can handle. For example, if your child is struggling with reading, help him focus on understanding the main idea. Have your child retell the story in his own words. Ask your child‚Äôs teacher for ways to help. Keep building small successes to turn them into big ones. - Give your child challenging work in a subject she thinks is easy. Ask your child‚Äôs teacher for ideas if necessary. For example, if your child thinks reading is easy, give her a book with a complex story. Or find a book with more advanced vocabulary. Then reading will be more challenging. Your child will have to work hard to be successful. Help your child see that this can be a rewarding experience.

# parent/exploreStudentStandardMatter.jsp
h1.exploreStudentStandardMatter = Standards, Testing, and NCLB
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.1 = Parents and caretakers, teachers, and schools all have a responsibility to help children acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to earn good jobs, make informed decisions, and become successful and contributing citizens. These skills and knowledge are described by your state's <b>standards</b>.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.2 = State <b>testing</b> is one important tool that is used to determine whether your child is achieving these important standards. In addition, state tests inform decisions regarding the effectiveness of schools' and districts' efforts to support your child. The federal legislation that sets the parameters for this decision-making process is known as the No Child Left Behind Act (or NCLB). <b>NCLB</b> is the 2002 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.3 = Standards have long been a part of successful classrooms. Good teachers have always set goals for their students and have worked to help them reach those objectives. State standards clearly articulate these goals to ensure that they are available to everyone. Knowing and understanding the standards is one way you can support your child's education. By knowing what is expected, you can work with your child and his or her teacher(s) to reach these important standards.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.4 = When you first look at a list of standards, you might wonder how teachers and students can be expected to accomplish so much. Even though standards may appear to be a complicated to-do list, they are really just a way of setting learning goals that give your child the greatest opportunity to succeed in whatever he or she decides to do.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.5 = If you've ever played a sport or learned a new skill, you're probably familiar with the importance of goals. In order to improve, you need to know what you can already do and what skills you need to move ahead. In the same way, standards help everyone involved in your child's education stay focused on important skills.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.6 = Each state has its own set of standards for student learning. State standards are based on educational research, the perspective of businesses that may employ your child, post-secondary schools or institutes that require certain entry skills, and a variety of other constituencies. State standards are actually written by teachers, parents, educational leaders, and business people to ensure that students are prepared for future opportunities in Indiana and, quite possibly, nationally or internationally.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.7 = Testing is one way to determine if children are reaching standards. We all want our children to be successful, and tests help to identify your child's strengths and highlight skill areas that could be improved, which is essential information for you and your child's teacher(s). In order to make the right decisions about how to help your child, you, and your child's teachers need reliable information about what can be done to help your child achieve the standards. Additionally, testing can help teachers recognize when your child is ready to strive for more challenging goals.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.8 = Test results, along with other information, guide teachers in lesson planning and help them identify appropriate teaching strategies that match each child's needs. As a parent, you may want to talk to your child's teacher(s) about how tests are being used to support instruction.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.9 = >On January 8, 2002, helping all children succeed in school became more than just a goal-it became law. NCLB is a law built upon the tenet that setting high standards for children will help them succeed in school and, ultimately, in life. NCLB holds schools responsible for helping all children learn.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.10 = As your child advances through school, you will probably ask the same question that many parents do: "How is my child doing?" Your child's teacher will help you answer this question. NCLB requires states to test all students, and then use the results of that test to help parents, and the public in general, understand the extent to which students are meeting standards. Your child's results on this state test will be shared with you. If your child does not score well on a part of the test, it may indicate that he or she needs extra help in that area.
p.exploreStudentStandardMatter.11 = The results of state tests give both state and federal government a common tool to determine which schools and districts in your state are helping children reach the standards and which schools and districts need to make improvements. As part of NCLB, you will receive a "report card" for your child's school and school district. This report card makes it possible for you to consider how well your school and district helps all students learn, regardless of their background and strengths.
