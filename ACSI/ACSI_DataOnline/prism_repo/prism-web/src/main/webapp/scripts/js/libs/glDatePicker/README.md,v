============

A simple, customizable, lightweight date picker calendar plugin for jQuery

Find the latest download, fully functional examples and instructions on how
to use and configure the plugin at: http://code.gautamlad.com/glDatePicker/

### Features

- forward and back navigation
- current date highlight
- restricting selection of dates outside of a range
- restricting selection of dates beyond N-days from start date
- restricting forward / backwards month navigation
- individual styles per date picker (in case you have multiples on one page)


Installation / Usage
--------------------

Extract the js and css folders from the archive.

Then add references to the stylesheet and javascript files in your page:

    <link href="css/default.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/glDatePicker.js"></script>


Make sure you have a textbox that you can tie the plugin to:

    <input type="text" id="date" />


Finally bind the plugin to the input textbox and set any options you want:

    $("#date").glDatePicker(
    {
        allowOld: false,
        startDate: new Date("September 5, 2011"),
        endDate: new Date("October 26, 2011"),
        onChange: function(target, newDate)
        {
            alert("You selected: " + newDate);
        }
    });
